    <h2>Editor Design</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to build a modern Markdown editor that
      combines the simplicity of plain text with the power of a WYSIWYG
      interface. I chose <strong>Tiptap</strong> for its flexibility and
      seamless integration with React. The interface was designed to be
      <strong>intuitive and minimalistic</strong>, providing a smooth and enjoyable
      writing experience for both technical writers and developers.

    <h2>Custom Toolbar and Markdown Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>
      The editor includes a <strong>custom toolbar</strong> that allows users to
      easily apply formatting such as bold, italic, headings, lists, and quotes.
      Native <strong>Markdown shortcuts</strong> are also supported to enable
      fast and natural writing. All UI components are styled with{" "}
      <strong>SCSS</strong> to ensure visual consistency and responsive
      behaviour across different screen sizes.
