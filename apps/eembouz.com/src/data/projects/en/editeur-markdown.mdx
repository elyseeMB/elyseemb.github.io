## Editor Design

The goal of this project was to build a modern Markdown editor that
combines the simplicity of plain text with the power of a WYSIWYG
interface. I chose __Tiptap__ for its flexibility and
seamless integration with React. The interface was designed to be
__intuitive and minimalistic__, providing a smooth and enjoyable
writing experience for both technical writers and developers.

## Custom Toolbar and Markdown Shortcuts

The editor includes a __custom toolbar__ that allows users to
easily apply formatting such as bold, italic, headings, lists, and quotes.
Native __Markdown shortcuts__ are also supported to enable
fast and natural writing. All UI components are styled with
__SCSS__ to ensure visual consistency and responsive
behaviour across different screen sizes.
