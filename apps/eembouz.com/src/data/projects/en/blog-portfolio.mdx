## Objective

Build an online showcase to present my projects and share my experience as
a developer. The portfolio highlights my technical work, while the blog
allows me to document what I learn and contribute to the community.

It also serves as my personal documentation — a place where I can come
back and find solutions to problems I've already solved.

## The Portfolio

The portfolio presents my projects in a clean and direct way. Each project
has its own page with a clear technical explanation.

## The Blog

The blog is where I share my technical discoveries. I write practical
tutorials, project-based insights, and simplified explanations of complex
concepts.

The goal is to make challenging ideas more accessible and to provide
concrete, reusable solutions for other projects. Articles support
interactive React components thanks to __MDX__, allowing me to illustrate
concepts with live demos instead of simple screenshots.

## Technical Choices

I chose __Astro__ for its performance-first philosophy. Unlike traditional
JavaScript frameworks, Astro generates ultra-fast static pages and only
ships JavaScript when it's truly needed.

The architecture is based on a __monorepo__ hosting both the blog and
portfolio. Core components such as the Header, Footer, and layout system
are centralized in a shared package and reused across both applications.
This avoids code duplication and ensures consistent styling across the
whole platform.

For styling, I opted for __pure CSS__ instead of Tailwind to keep total
control over the visual identity and craft a unique design. Content is
written in __MDX__ to combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of
React components.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

The deployment architecture ensures stability and performance while
enabling rapid iteration. I implemented a multi-environment setup with
three levels: development, staging, and production.

Production is hosted on __GitHub Pages__ for its reliability, while
staging and preview environments run on __Cloudflare Pages__ for speed.
Each feature branch automatically generates its own preview environment,
making code reviews and testing much easier.

Full automation via __GitHub Actions__ orchestrates the entire workflow:
pushing a branch triggers a build and preview deployment, and merging to
main deploys to production. Astro builds are optimized with __Turbo__, and
__pnpm__ ensures fast, reproducible installs.

This workflow lets me work on multiple features in parallel, each with its
own isolated environment, validate on staging, and then deploy confidently
to production.

## Performance & SEO

SEO was a priority from the very beginning. Every page includes complete
metadata, an automatically generated XML sitemap, and an optimized
robots.txt file.

The HTML structure is semantic and accessible, with proper tags for easier
indexing. URLs are clean and descriptive, and the site automatically
generates Open Graph tags for optimal social sharing.
