    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Build an online showcase to present my projects and share my experience as
      a developer. The portfolio highlights my technical work, while the blog
      allows me to document what I learn and contribute to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also serves as my personal documentation — a place where I can come
      back and find solutions to problems I've already solved.
    </p>

    <h2>The Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      The portfolio presents my projects in a clean and direct way. Each project
      has its own page with a clear technical explanation.
    </p>

    src={"/project/portfolio/2.png"}

    style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
  />

    <h2>The Blog</h2>
    <p>
      The blog is where I share my technical discoveries. I write practical
      tutorials, project-based insights, and simplified explanations of complex
      concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to make challenging ideas more accessible and to provide
      concrete, reusable solutions for other projects. Articles support
      interactive React components thanks to __MDX__, allowing me to illustrate
      concepts with live demos instead of simple screenshots.

    <h2>Technical Choices</h2>
    <p>
      I chose __Astro__ for its performance-first philosophy. Unlike traditional
      JavaScript frameworks, Astro generates ultra-fast static pages and only
      ships JavaScript when it’s truly needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architecture is based on a __monorepo__ hosting both the blog and
      portfolio. Core components such as the Header, Footer, and layout system
      are centralized in a shared package and reused across both applications.
      This avoids code duplication and ensures consistent styling across the
      whole platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      For styling, I opted for __pure CSS__ instead of Tailwind to keep total
      control over the visual identity and craft a unique design. Content is
      written in __MDX__ to combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of
      React components.
    </p>
  </div>
  <img
    class="picture"
    height={500}
    src={"/project/portfolio/7.png"}
    alt="project"
    style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
  />
  <img
    class="picture"
    height={500}
    src={"/project/portfolio/8.png"}
    alt="project"
    style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
  />
</GridBlock>

  <div>
    <h2>Infrastructure & Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      The deployment architecture ensures stability and performance while
      enabling rapid iteration. I implemented a multi-environment setup with
      three levels: development, staging, and production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Production is hosted on __GitHub Pages__ for its reliability, while
      staging and preview environments run on __Cloudflare Pages__ for speed.
      Each feature branch automatically generates its own preview environment,
      making code reviews and testing much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full automation via __GitHub Actions__ orchestrates the entire workflow:
      pushing a branch triggers a build and preview deployment, and merging to
      main deploys to production. Astro builds are optimized with __Turbo__, and
      __pnpm__ ensures fast, reproducible installs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This workflow lets me work on multiple features in parallel, each with its
      own isolated environment, validate on staging, and then deploy confidently
      to production.

    <h2>Performance & SEO</h2>
    <p>
      SEO was a priority from the very beginning. Every page includes complete
      metadata, an automatically generated XML sitemap, and an optimized
      robots.txt file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML structure is semantic and accessible, with proper tags for easier
      indexing. URLs are clean and descriptive, and the site automatically
      generates Open Graph tags for optimal social sharing.
    </p>
