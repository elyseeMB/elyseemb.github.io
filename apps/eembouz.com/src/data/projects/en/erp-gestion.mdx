    <h2>Design System Creation</h2>
    <p>
      To prepare for the redesign of the application, I started by creating a
      component library. To visualize and test these components easily, I chose
      to work with Storybook, which allowed me to build each component in an
      isolated environment before integrating them into the application. Since
      the project includes many interface elements, I organized the library
      following the Atomic Design methodology, dividing components into{" "}
      <strong>atoms</strong>, <strong>molecules</strong>, and{" "}
      <strong>organisms</strong>.

    <h2>Admin Interface Development</h2>
    <p>
      I built a scalable admin interface hosted on a separate subdomain to
      streamline the management of users, articles, taxonomies with hierarchical
      structures, and content collections. This administration panel also
      provides full analytics and performance monitoring through a complete and
      intuitive dashboard.

  <h2>Integration of the Tiptap Editor for Article Writing</h2>
  <p>
  I integrated Tiptap, a modern and highly customizable text editor, to simplify article creation and formatting.  
  With its intuitive UI, Tiptap makes it easy to insert rich text, images, links, and code blocks.
  
  The goal was to provide authors with a simple yet powerful tool to produce high-quality content, while ensuring better consistency and flexibility in article management.

    <h2>Technical Architecture & Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      The project is structured as a full-stack monorepo managed with pnpm
      workspaces, grouping the backend, the CMS, and the design system within a
      single development environment. This structure improves collaboration,
      code reuse, and consistency across all applications. Deployment is fully
      automated with Ansible, which handles server configuration, application
      deployment through Docker, and provisioning of services such as PostgreSQL
      and Nginx. This ensures a fast, reliable, and fully reproducible setup
      across all environments.
