    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Durand Construction</strong> is a company based in 
      <strong>Brazzaville</strong>, active in the fields of building construction

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      The interface is built around a <strong>modular layout</strong>, centered
      on a clean typography system and a visual rhythm inspired by architectural
      design principles. The structure highlights the key sections —{" "}
      <em>Work</em>, <em>About</em>, and <em>Blog</em> — with a readable and
      balanced hierarchy.
    </p>
    The website was developed using a <strong>static architecture</strong>,
    favoring speed, security, and minimal maintenance.
